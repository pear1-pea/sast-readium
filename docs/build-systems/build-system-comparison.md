## Key Differences

### Advantages of Xmake

- **Simpler Configuration**: Lua-based syntax is more readable
- **Built-in Package Management**: No need for external package managers
- **Faster Builds**: Built-in caching and optimization
- **Modern Design**: More intuitive API and better defaults

### Advantages of CMake

- **Mature Ecosystem**: Wider industry adoption
- **Extensive Documentation**: More tutorials and examples available
- **Tool Integration**: Better IDE and tool support
- **Package Availability**: More packages available through vcpkg/conan

### Current Limitations in Xmake Build

1. **Qt6 SVG/Tools**: Some Qt6 packages not available in xmake-repo, falls back to system Qt
2. **clangd Auto-config**: Not implemented (manual setup required)
3. **Package Ecosystem**: Smaller package repository compared to vcpkg

## Build Output Comparison

Both build systems produce:

- Same executable binary
- Same asset structure
- Same translation files
- Same deployment structure

## Migration Guide

### From CMake to Xmake

1. Install xmake
2. Use existing source code (no changes needed)
3. Run `xmake` instead of `cmake`
4. Same dependencies and system requirements

### From Xmake to CMake

1. Use existing CMake configuration
2. Same source code and dependencies
3. Run `cmake` commands as documented

## Current Status

The xmake build system is **under development** with the following status:

### ✅ Working Features

- Basic project structure and configuration
- Poppler-Qt6 dependency detection
- Cross-platform compiler detection
- Asset and resource management
- Documentation and build scripts

### ⚠️ Known Issues

- **Qt Detection Assertion Error**: Assertion failure in MSYS2 + MSVC environment
- **Qt Rules Compatibility**: Some Qt-specific build rules need refinement
- **Mixed Environment Challenges**: MSYS2 + Visual Studio combination causes conflicts

### 🔄 Recommended Usage

- **Primary**: Continue using CMake build system (fully functional)
- **Testing**: Use xmake for non-Qt components and experimentation
- **Future**: Complete Qt integration fixes for full functionality

## Conclusion

The xmake build system provides **foundational infrastructure** for the project:

- Core build configuration is complete
- Package management is functional
- Platform detection works correctly
- Documentation is comprehensive

**Current Recommendation**: Use CMake for production builds while xmake integration is being refined.

Both build systems can coexist without conflicts, allowing gradual migration once Qt integration issues are resolved.
